Git 

	In this session, we are going to discuss about

		Version Control Systems

		About GIT

		Git WorkFlow Life Cycle

		Creating GIT Repo

		Git Commands

		

1) What is Version Control System 

Version Control sysstem is a systsem that records changes to a file or set of files

There are various version control systems are there as

	-> Local Version Control Systems

	-> Centralized Version Control Systems

	-> Distributed Version Control Systems (GIT)


2) Why Vesion Control System : 

	Version Control system provides idea of coding implemented in earlier versions

	Gives you great support for different version of same project 

	Providing concurrent work and implements merge changes 


Git : 

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Every git working directory contains a full flexged repository with complete history of tracking capabilities.

It is not dependent on neetwork acccess or a central server. 

Goals : 

   Speed

   Support for development

   Fully Distributed

   Able to handle large projects efficiently


In Git we have main states or areas known as

   -> Working Directory 

	This is the git repository diretory, where we can store all the information. 

   -> Staging Area : It is a simple file, generally presnent in your git diretory, that stores information 
		about all the commits. {whatever code you want to push, first to be commited into staging area}

   -> Git Local Directory : This is the local git repository, where the changes get finalized before going to 				git remote. 

   -> Git Remote Directory : This is the directory, where we can get all updated commited code, and all changes 				will be reflected here.

After creating repository, open git bash and in that run the below commands

git config --global user.name "prasannakasyap"

git config --global user.email "puiangtraining@gmail.com"


First step you need to do is 

Once any client gives git repo, first you need to clone that. 

for that you please run the command as

git clone gitUrl

git clone https://github.com/Prasannakasyap/JavaTraining

How to add a file to the staging area 

git add .

Hot to add the files to local repository 

git commit -m "message"

git commit -m "Git Notes uploaded"

How to push the files to remote repository 

git push origin main

To see the status of the current git repository please give the command as

git status 

To See the difference between committed code and uncommitted code, then you please run the command as

git diff

To see the list of commands executed in github, and see the history of logs, then we need the command as

git log

git log --oneline


git commit -a : 

Commits a snapshot of all changes in the working directory. 

Which situation, we need to use git commit -a is, assume you are not created any new files, only you did modifications in the given file, then need to record the changes of existing file, then no need to give 
git add ., instead of directly you can run the commnad as

git commit -a -m "message"

here -a records the snapshot of given file changes as new files are not created. 

If you give the command 

git status in git working directory, it shows the list of files/content
which is not added to the staging area 

How to Undo the changes of the given file, 
as i want to retain the content as old commit only, then 

git checkout filename 

Git Reset allows you to move commits from history back into working or staging area. 

It can also be used to throw the changes away. 

Example :

git add hello.txt

then its added to the staging area. 

Now, if you want to unstage the given files, then 

git reset HEAD hello.txt

Now, whatever staged content will be unstaged automatically. 

Git Branching : 
________________

Here, we need to take care of merge conflicts and individual code to be idenfied then we need the help of branches.

You can create a branch as 

git branch branch_name

git branch java1

You can redirect to the branch as 

git checkout branch_name 

Or You need to create a branch and move directly into that branch, then 

git checkout -b branch_name 

To refresh the list of branches in git, please run the command as

git remote update

To see list of branches available, then 

git pull 

Used to pull the code from one branch to another branch

To remove any branch 

git branch -D branch_name
